### Partition

> Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes
> less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained
> within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than
> x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right
> partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
