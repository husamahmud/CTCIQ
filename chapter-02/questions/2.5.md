### Sum Lists

> You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a
> single digit.The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1 's digit
> is
> at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and
> returns
> the sum as a linked list.

> EXAMPLE <br/>
> Input: (7-> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). That is, 617 + 295. <br/> Output: 2 ->
> 1 ->
> 9
> That is, 912. <br/>
> FOLLOW UP
> Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above
> problem. <br/>
> EXAMPLE <br/>
> input:(6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5).That is,617 + 295. <br/>Output: 9 -> 1 -> 2.
> That is,912.
